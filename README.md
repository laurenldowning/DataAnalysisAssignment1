# DataAnalysisAssignment1
For this assignment, it was required that a Rmarkdown notebook that reproduced the analysis and visualisations displayed on [MediaHack's Coronavirus Dashboard](https://mediahack.co.za/datastories/coronavirus/dashboard/) be created. The notebook had to include the code used to wrangle, process, and output the data, in addition to any visualisations that were produced.
